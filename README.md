# Advent of Code

## 2024

Implementing in (overengineered?) Go with the [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) editor. My goal is to get **all 50** stars in a timely manner.[^stars]

**Why Go?**

I like this language: Although it's not perfect (is any language?), it combines speed, simplicity, and idiomatic/opinionated patterns.

> **Practice makes perfect:** I would like to work as a software developer focusing on Go ðŸ˜‰

[^stars]: The holidays are a busy time for everyone; but I'm doing fine so far.
