# Advent of Code

> [!NOTE]  
> **All of my solutions here are devised without the assistance of LLMs.** While I have nothing against AI (I believe it can be a legitimate productivity tool), the purpose of *Advent of Code* is, in my opinion, to hone one's skills and enjoy the challenge... much in the same way that people run in a marathon, although driving the same distance is faster and less effort.

Implementing in Go with the [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) editor. The code is purposefully more verbose than many other solutions I see in discussion threads because I try to mimic more complex projects. As such, I often declare custom types and take a Post-OOP approach of defining methods on these.

My goal is to get **all stars** in a timely manner this year.[^stars]

**Why Go?**

I like this language: Although it's not perfect (is any language?), it combines speed, simplicity, and idiomatic/opinionated patterns.

**Practice makes perfect:** I would like to work as a software developer focusing on Go ðŸ˜‰

[^stars]: The holidays are a busy time for everyone; but I'm doing fine so far.
